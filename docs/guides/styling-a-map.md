# Styling a Map

It's very common for people to want their maps to look a specific way. In fact, there are services which allow you to customize a map however you see fit. These services will generate a JSON snippet containing all of your styles.

Here are a few services which can help you create a collection of custom styles...

 - [Google Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com)
 - [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/)
 
Once you have generated your map styles, copy the JSON snippet and apply it to your map.

## Styling a map in JavaScript

Using the `.styleMap()` method of the `googleMapsPlugin` object in JavaScript, you can replace the entire style in one fell swoop...

```js
// Add styles generated by Snazzy Maps (or wherever)
var styles = [...];

// Apply those styles to an existing map
googleMapsPlugin.styleMap('gm-map-1', styles);
```

::: warning STYLES NOT STICKING?
If you're having trouble getting it to work, you may need to delay the application of your styles until the map is completely ready. Move this code into a snippet that doesn't run until the page is fully loaded.

## Styling a map in Twig

To apply your styles in Twig, add the `styles` [option](/dynamic-maps/dynamic/#options) when you initially [create the map](/dynamic-maps/dynamic/).

```twig
{# Add styles generated by Snazzy Maps (or wherever) #}
{% set styles = [...] %}

{# Create the map using the specified styles #}
{{ googleMaps.dynamic(locations, {
    styles: styles
}) }}
```
