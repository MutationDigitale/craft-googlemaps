# ðŸ”§ Exporting the Address data

<update-message/>

There are now two distinct options for exporting Address data. Your Addresses can now be exported in a **condensed** format (where an Address occupies a single column), or an **expanded** format (where Address subfield data are spread across multiple columns).
