# ðŸ”§ Render a map in Twig

<update-message/>

Generally speaking, the concepts of creating a map have remaining largely the same. The code required to generate a map is very similar to how it was in Smart Map. In the new Google Maps plugin, however, the resulting maps are far more flexible.

### Dynamic Maps

In the case of **dynamic maps**, you are now creating a [Dynamic Map Model](/models/dynamic-map-model/). You can manipulate that model as much as you'd like before eventually rendering it on the page (with the `.tag()` parameter).

#### Render a dynamic map `<div>` tag.

```twig
{# OLD #}
{{ craft.smartMap.map(locations, options) }}

{# NEW #}
{{ googleMaps.map(locations, options).tag() }}
```

Several of the `options` have changed. Take a look at the new available [dynamic map options](/dynamic-maps/map-management/#map-locations-options).

### Static Maps

In the case of **static maps**, you are now creating a [Static Map Model](/models/static-map-model/). You can manipulate that model as much as you'd like before eventually rendering it on the page. Append the `tag()` parameter to render a complete `<img>` tag, or `.src()` parameter to only get the `src` attribute.

#### Render a static map `<img>` tag.

```twig
{# OLD #}
{{ craft.smartMap.img(locations, options) }}

{# NEW #}
{{ googleMaps.img(locations, options).tag() }}
```

#### Render a static map `src` attribute value.

```twig
{# OLD #}
{{ craft.smartMap.imgSrc(locations, options) }}

{# NEW #}
{{ googleMaps.img(locations, options).src() }}
```

Several of the options have changed. Take a look at the new available [static map options](/models/static-map-model/#construct-locations-options).
