# 🔧 Internationalization Support

<update-message/>

**The good news is,** the [Address field](/address-field/) is more flexible and customizable than ever before! The subfields can be [rearranged & renamed](/address-field/settings/) to accommodate for international formats.

**The bad news is,** the new Google Maps plugin does not contain any of the language translations which existed in Smart Map. Both the verbiage and underlying architecture changed drastically, so it was not possible to maintain any previously written translations.

**Looking towards the future,** we would definitely like to translate the new Google Maps plugin into as many languages as possible! Please [reach out to us](https://www.doublesecretagency.com/contact) if you'd like to contribute a translation. 👏
