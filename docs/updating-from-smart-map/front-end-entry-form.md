# ðŸ”§ Front-End Entry Form

<update-message/>

Technically, the syntax did not change at all. But since _Craft itself_ has evolved, it's now possible to use an `input` function for each subfield.

For example, here's a single subfield using the `input` Twig function...

```twig
{# Visible subfield input (eg: "street1") #}
{{ input('text',
    'fields[myAddressField][street1]',
    entry.myAddressField.street1 ?? null,
    {
        placeholder: 'Street Address',
        id: 'address-street1'
    }
) }}
```

You can also set an `input` to be `hidden`. Certain subfields (ie: `formatted` and `raw`) can be hidden from view, as long as their values are still being submitted with the form.

```twig
{# Hidden subfield input (eg: "raw") #}
{{ input('hidden',
    'fields[myAddressField][raw]',
    entry.myAddressField.raw ?? null,
    {
        id: 'address-raw'
    }
) }}
```

Make sure that each individual Address subfield is accounted for.
