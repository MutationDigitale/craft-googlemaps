# Dynamic Maps

### API

In order to make the map-building process as easy as possible, this plugin provides a helpful API which stays relatively consistent between languages. Whether you are programming in JavaScript, Twig, or PHP, these methods will be equally accessible and provide nearly identical capabilities. [Read more](/dynamic-maps/api/)

### Chaining

### Map Management

### Universal Methods

Most methods are available across JavaScript, Twig, and PHP. Each language handles things differently _internally_, but methods will exhibit nearly identical behaviors across languages. [Read more](/dynamic-maps/universal-methods/)

### Additional JavaScript Methods

Certain methods are only available via JavaScript. [Read more](/dynamic-maps/javascript-methods/)

### Additional Twig & PHP Methods

### Locations

Multiple methods allow you to specify a set of `locations`. This represents a set of places (or a single place) that you want to appear on the map. However, the accepted value of `locations` varies slightly depending on which language you are working in. See the [Locations](/dynamic-maps/locations/) page for complete details.
