# Maps

## API

In order to make the map-building process as easy as possible, this plugin provides a helpful API which stays relatively consistent between languages. Whether you are programming in JavaScript, Twig, or PHP, these methods will be equally accessible and provide nearly identical capabilities.

## Locations

Multiple methods allow you to specify a set of `locations`. This represents a set of places (or a single place) that you want to appear on the map. However, the accepted value of `locations` varies slightly depending on which language you are working in. See the [Locations](/maps/locations/) page for complete details.
