# Field Settings

When you create a new Address field, you will see the following settings...

These fields only apply to the **content author**, or whomever is viewing the field in the control panel. These settings do not have any impact on how the address data is used on the front-end of your site.

## "Show map by default"

If checked, the address will automatically be shown on a map. If not checked, the map can be revealed by clicking on the "See on a map" link.

When viewing the map, you can drag & drop the pin to alter the geographic coordinates (it will not change the address).

## "Show coordinates as..."

**Input fields** - The coordinates will be _editable_ via standard form inputs. You will be able to manage the arrangement of these fields alongside the other subfields (see "Arrange subfield layout" below).

**Read-only text** - The coordinates will be visible, but _not editable_.

**Hidden** - The coordinates will be hidden.

## "Arrange subfield layout"

You can manage the subfields here. Drag & drop to put the fields in a specific order. Change the numeric value to control the field width percentage.

## "Set map center default position?"

If checked, this will immediately reveal a map with a draggable marker. Move the marker to where you would like the center of the map to be (by default).

You will also be able to set the default zoom level of the map. Remember, this only affects the content author in the control panel.
