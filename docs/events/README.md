# Events

## [Geocoding Event](/events/geocoding-event/)

The Geocoding Event is triggered when the system performs an [address lookup](/geocoding/). This allows the search results to be further manipulated via a custom module or 3rd party plugin.

## [Geolocation Event](/events/geolocation-event/)

The Geolocation Event is triggered after the system performs a [visitor geolocation](/geolocation/). The same event is triggered regardless of which 3rd party service is performing the geolocation.
