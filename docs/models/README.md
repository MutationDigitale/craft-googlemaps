# Models

## [Location Model](/models/location-model/)

The Location Model underpins both the Address Model and Geolocation Model. This gives the system a stability and universal compatibility for most situations.

## [Address Model](/models/address-model/)

The Address Model extends the Location Model, and adds data specific to a street address and/or the results of a Google Maps API lookup.

## [Geolocation Model](/models/geolocation-model/)

The Geolocation Model extends the Location Model, and adds data specific to a geolocation lookup. The geolocation service used will be determined in the control panel.


## [Coordinates](/models/coordinates/)

Not quite a Model, Coordinates define a standard format for `coords` values used within the plugin. It's also compatible with many facets of the Google Maps JavaScript API.
